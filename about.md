Hello and welcome to my personal  webpage. I am a Doctoral Ctudent in the School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) at the University of South Carolina.  I work as the Student Services Program Coordinator for SLIS.  I am also working on a Health Communication Certificate, which is a joint degree with SLIS, the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, and the Arnold School of Public Health.   My research interests are health informatics, health literacy, text mining, health communication barriers, and information systems. My current research looks at the intersection of public health and computational science to identify an alternate method to collect behavioral risk factor information.
